.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ps3
is an __xservername__ driver for the RSX (NVIDIA NV47-derived) found in
Sony's PlayStation 3 console.  This EXA-accelerated driver has support for
32-bit pixel depths.  TrueColor visual is supported for the current full
range of pixel depths (no current support for DirectColor).
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The 
.B ps3
driver supports the RSX hardware where available via a special framebuffer
and VRAM, FIFO and CTRL file descriptors provided by the kernel device driver.
ps3 uses the os-specific submodule fbdebhw(__drivermansuffix__) to talk
to the kernel device driver.  Currently a fbdevhw module is available for
Linux.

For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen
