.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ps3fb
is an __xservername__ driver for framebuffer devices.  This is a non-accelerated
driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported: 8, 15, 16, 24.
All visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor visual is
supported for the other depths.  Multi-head configurations are supported.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The 
.B ps3fb
driver supports all hardware where a framebuffer driver is available.
ps3fb uses the os-specific submodule ps3fbhw(__drivermansuffix__) to talk
to the kernel
device driver.  Currently a ps3fbhw module is available for linux.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to
this driver.
.PP
For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen 
section of the config file.  The
.B ps3fb
driver can pick up the currently used video mode from the framebuffer 
driver and will use it if there are no video modes configured.
.PP
For PCI boards you might have to add a BusID line to the Device
section.  See above for a sample line.  You can use \*q\__xservername__
-scanpci\*q
to figure out the correct values.
.PP
The following driver
